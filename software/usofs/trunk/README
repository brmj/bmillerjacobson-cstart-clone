USOFS, or Uncontrolled SubOrbital Flight Simulator, is a program designed to simulate the flight of uncontrolled rockets on suborbital space flights, i.e. rockets which "go straight up and then go straight down", attaining a maximum altitude of at least 100 km. The USOFS software was originally developed to inform design decisions for the OHKLA project.
