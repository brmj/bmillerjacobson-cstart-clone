The task of the Spacecraft Engineering Workgroup (SEW) is to design the physical structure of both lunar mission spacecraft - the command module and lunar lander. This includes the size, shape, construction material and construction techniques for these craft, as well as central systems such as power generation and plumbing. Issues such as aerodynamic stability during reentry, heat shielding during reentry and radiation shielding for space travel are also within the scope of the SEW.
