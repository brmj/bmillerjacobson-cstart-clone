The task of the Propulsion Workgroup (PW) is to devise propulsion solutions for all stages of the mission: A rocket booster to get the CSM and LM into LEO, a service engine on the CSM to perform trans lunar and trans Earth injections, RCS on the CSM to provide orientation control and an engine on the lunar lander for ascent and descent.
