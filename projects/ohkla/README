OHKLA (Open Hybrid Karman Line Attempt) is CSTART's project to use a hybrid rocket to carry a small payload beyond the 100km Karman Line. The OHKLA rocket will be as small and light as possible, will not be controlled and will carry only the minimum equipment required to verify maximum altitude and enable recovery.
